    \item Motivation: figurative language as a barrier to accessibility, simplification, and downstream NLP
    \item Limitations of supervised, task-specific approaches
    \item Rise of LLMs and agentic reasoning
    \item Contributions
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Zero/one-shot/few-shot agentic system for figurative language handling
              \item Unified treatment of idioms and metaphors (is this the case?)
              \item Empirical evaluation of replacement quality \cite{sample2024}
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
