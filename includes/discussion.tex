\section{Discussion \& Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What agentic systems can/cannot do
    \item Where metaphors fundamentally resist literalization
    \item Limitations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conceptual: metaphors encoding meaning that cannot be fully literalized; replacement oversimplifying nuance
        \item Evaluation limits: Subjectivity of human evaluation; no gold standard for metaphor replacement
        \item Model dependence: Results vary across LLM providers
        \item Scope limits: Sentence/MWE level focus; no discourse-wide tracking; primarily English
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
