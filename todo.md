# Research & Development To-Do

## Research
- [ ] **Evaluation Methods for Replacement**
    - Research and decide on evaluation methods for the figurative language replacement task.
    - Start by looking into how similar tasks (e.g., simplification, style transfer) are evaluated.
- [ ] **Methodology Comparison**
    - Compare annotation methodologies of VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus (VUAMC) with other datasets (e.g., SemEval).
    - Investigate if datasets can be merged.
- [ ] **Metaphor Representation**
    - Research effective formats for presenting metaphors to agents (input) and structuring the output.
    - Look into how datasets structure their data for inspiration.

## Development
- [ ] **VUAMC Client**
    - Verify client interface with the dataset.
    - Integrate into the main pipeline.
- [ ] **Oxford Text Archive**
    - Monitor access to OTA or find reliable mirrors/alternatives.
    - Ensure citations reflect the current access method if necessary.
- [ ] **Detection Prototype**
    - Refine the "Canonical Metaphor Detection I/O" (v1).
    - Move beyond detection to initial replacement experiments.
